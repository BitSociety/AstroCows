# Astro Cows by Bit Society
The first stream, meant to be an introduction to unity and programming in C#.
 
It is a simple game, a homage to Flappy Bird and other games of its ilk.

The streams will be happening at twitch.tv/bitsociety, every Tuesday and Thursday from 8PM-10PM. 

They will be uploaded episodically to YouTube very soon after the stream.
